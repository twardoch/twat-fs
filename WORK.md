### Current Focus: Implementation Complete

#### Implemented Features
1. **Git Tag-Based Semversioning** ✓
   - Hatch-vcs properly configured in pyproject.toml
   - Version automatically detected from git tags
   - Version format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.postN+gHASH.dDATE`
   - Runtime version access through __version__.py

2. **CLI Version Display** ✓
   - Added `version()` method to TwatFS class
   - Accessible via `twat-fs version` command
   - Fallback to importlib.metadata if needed

3. **Local Development Scripts** ✓
   - `scripts/build.py` - Build package with version detection
   - `scripts/test.py` - Run tests with coverage
   - `scripts/lint.py` - Run code quality checks
   - `scripts/release.py` - Prepare release packages
   - `scripts/dev.py` - Development utility commands
   - `scripts/build_binary.py` - Build standalone executables
   - `Makefile` - Convenient make targets

4. **GitHub Actions CI/CD** ✓
   - Enhanced existing CI pipeline
   - Added binary building for Linux, macOS, Windows
   - Automated PyPI publishing on git tags
   - GitHub Releases with binary assets

5. **Installation Experience** ✓
   - `install.sh` - Cross-platform shell script
   - `install.ps1` - PowerShell script for Windows
   - Binary downloads from GitHub Releases
   - Updated README with installation instructions

#### Key Findings from Analysis

**Project Structure**:
- Python 3.10+ package using hatchling build backend
- Already has hatch-vcs configured for version management
- Existing git tags from v1.0.0 to v2.5.4
- Comprehensive test suite with pytest
- Well-structured provider system for file uploads

**Current Version Configuration**:
- `pyproject.toml` already has `[tool.hatch.version]` with `source = 'vcs'`
- Version file generation configured at `src/twat_fs/__version__.py`
- Version scheme set to 'post-release'

**Testing Infrastructure**:
- pytest configured with coverage reporting
- Multiple test environments (unit, integration, benchmark)
- Test fixtures for different providers
- Some missing dependencies causing test failures

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1 Priority**: 
- Validate and enhance existing semversioning setup
- Ensure version detection works reliably
- Add user-facing version information

**Technical Approach**:
- Leverage existing hatch-vcs configuration
- Build on current testing infrastructure
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

### Blockers and Challenges

**Current Issues**:
- Some test dependencies missing (fal_client, botocore, responses)
- Test failures in existing suite need resolution
- Linting errors need fixing before CI implementation

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Address existing test issues first
- Ensure current functionality works before adding new features
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage throughout changes

### Next Steps

1. **Test current version system** - Verify hatch-vcs works with git tags
2. **Fix test dependencies** - Ensure all tests can run properly
3. **Implement version display** - Add --version to CLI
4. **Create build scripts** - Local development and release scripts
5. **Setup CI/CD pipeline** - GitHub Actions for testing and releases

### Quality Assurance Plan

- All new code will have corresponding tests
- Maintain >90% test coverage
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Use provided linting and formatting tools
- Test on multiple Python versions and platforms

### Success Metrics

- Version automatically detected from git tags
- All tests passing with good coverage
- Local scripts work reliably
- CI/CD pipeline operational
- Binary builds successful on all platforms
