# TWAT-FS Documentation

Welcome to the TWAT-FS (TWo-fAcTor FileSystem) documentation!

## What is TWAT-FS?

TWAT-FS is a secure filesystem that implements two-factor authentication for enhanced security. It provides an additional layer of protection for your sensitive files by requiring both a password and a second authentication factor before granting access.

## Key Features

- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Secure your files with both password and TOTP/HOTP
- **FUSE Integration**: Mount as a regular filesystem on Linux/macOS
- **Transparent Encryption**: Files are encrypted at rest
- **Easy CLI**: Simple command-line interface for management
- **Python-based**: Built with Python for cross-platform compatibility
