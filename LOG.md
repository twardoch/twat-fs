## Completed Work

1. Created file upload functionality with multiple providers:
   - Created `src/twat_fs/upload_providers/` directory
   - Implemented `fal.py` provider with simple file upload functionality
   - Adapted private Dropbox implementation into `dropbox.py` provider
   - Created main `upload.py` module with provider selection logic
   - Added S3 provider with AWS S3 upload functionality

2. Implemented CLI interface:
   - Created `__main__.py` with Fire CLI integration
   - Added `upload_file` command with provider selection
   - Updated `__init__.py` to expose main functionality

3. Updated documentation:
   - Added new functionality to README.md
   - Documented provider configuration
   - Added usage examples for both Python API and CLI

4. Enhanced provider functionality:
   - Added `provider_auth` functions to check authentication
   - Added loguru warnings for missing credentials
   - Implemented provider fallback mechanism
   - Added support for provider lists and preferences
   - Added S3 as the default preferred provider

5. Created test framework:
   - Added comprehensive test skeleton in `tests/test_upload.py`
   - Created test fixtures and mocks
   - Added test data directory
   - Implemented tests for auth, upload, and fallback functionality
   - Added S3-specific tests for authentication and upload scenarios
   - Added integration tests with real providers in `test_integration.py`
   - Added edge cases and error condition tests
   - Added performance tests with different file sizes
   - Added tests for S3 multipart uploads
   - Added tests for different S3 endpoint configurations
   - Added tests for various AWS credential providers

6. Refactored provider authentication and initialization:
   - Split provider initialization into two steps:
     1. `get_credentials`: Simple function to check and return required env variables
     2. `get_provider`: Function to import dependencies and initialize provider client
   - Updated all providers (S3, FAL, Dropbox) to use the new pattern
   - Added proper typing and error handling
   - Improved logging and error messages
   - Made provider initialization more efficient by checking credentials before importing dependencies
   - Updated main upload module to use the new provider pattern
   - Added better provider client management

7. Added provider setup functionality:
   - Implemented `setup_provider` function to check individual provider status
   - Added `setup_providers` function to check all available providers
   - Added detailed help messages for each provider's setup requirements
   - Added dependency installation instructions
   - Updated all tests to use the new provider pattern:
     - Updated unit tests in `test_upload.py`
     - Updated integration tests in `test_integration.py`
     - Updated S3 advanced tests in `test_s3_advanced.py`
   - Added new test cases for provider setup
   - Improved error messages and setup instructions
   - Added comprehensive credential configuration guides
   - Added CLI commands for checking provider setup:
     - `setup provider <name>`: Check setup status for a specific provider
     - `setup all`: Check setup status for all available providers

## TODO4:

1. Add better provider API:
   - Create a formal provider interface/protocol
   - Add provider discovery mechanism

2. Improve S3 provider API:
   - Add specific error types for S3-related failures
   - Improve AWS error code handling and messages
   - Add support for AWS IAM roles and instance profiles
   - Add support for AWS SSO credentials
   - Add support for S3 bucket policies and ACLs
   - Implement S3 multipart uploads for large files
   - Add support for S3 transfer acceleration
   - Add caching of S3 credentials
