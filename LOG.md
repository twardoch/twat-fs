## Completed Work

1. Created file upload functionality with multiple providers:
   - Created `src/twat_fs/upload_providers/` directory
   - Implemented `fal.py` provider with simple file upload functionality
   - Adapted private Dropbox implementation into `dropbox.py` provider
   - Created main `upload.py` module with provider selection logic
   - Added S3 provider with AWS S3 upload functionality

2. Implemented CLI interface:
   - Created `__main__.py` with Fire CLI integration
   - Added `upload_file` command with provider selection
   - Updated `__init__.py` to expose main functionality

3. Updated documentation:
   - Added new functionality to README.md
   - Documented provider configuration
   - Added usage examples for both Python API and CLI

4. Enhanced provider functionality:
   - Added `provider_auth` functions to check authentication
   - Added loguru warnings for missing credentials
   - Implemented provider fallback mechanism
   - Added support for provider lists and preferences
   - Added S3 as the default preferred provider

5. Created test framework:
   - Added comprehensive test skeleton in `tests/test_upload.py`
   - Created test fixtures and mocks
   - Added test data directory
   - Implemented tests for auth, upload, and fallback functionality
   - Added S3-specific tests for authentication and upload scenarios
   - Added integration tests with real providers in `test_integration.py`
   - Added edge cases and error condition tests
   - Added performance tests with different file sizes
   - Added tests for S3 multipart uploads
   - Added tests for different S3 endpoint configurations
   - Added tests for various AWS credential providers

6. Refactored provider authentication and initialization:
   - Split provider initialization into two steps:
     1. `get_credentials`: Simple function to check and return required env variables
     2. `get_provider`: Function to import dependencies and initialize provider client
   - Updated all providers (S3, FAL, Dropbox) to use the new pattern
   - Added proper typing and error handling
   - Improved logging and error messages
   - Made provider initialization more efficient by checking credentials before importing dependencies
   - Updated main upload module to use the new provider pattern
   - Added better provider client management

7. Added provider setup functionality:
   - Implemented `setup_provider` function to check individual provider status
   - Added `setup_providers` function to check all available providers
   - Added detailed help messages for each provider's setup requirements
   - Added dependency installation instructions
   - Updated all tests to use the new provider pattern:
     - Updated unit tests in `test_upload.py`
     - Updated integration tests in `test_integration.py`
     - Updated S3 advanced tests in `test_s3_advanced.py`
   - Added new test cases for provider setup
   - Improved error messages and setup instructions
   - Added comprehensive credential configuration guides
   - Added CLI commands for checking provider setup:
     - `setup provider <name>`: Check setup status for a specific provider
     - `setup all`: Check setup status for all available providers

8. Improved provider interface and type system:
   - Created formal provider interfaces using Python's Protocol system:
     - `Provider` protocol defining what each provider module must implement
     - `ProviderClient` protocol defining what each provider's client must implement
   - Added runtime protocol checking with `@runtime_checkable`
   - Moved provider-specific help messages to their respective provider modules
   - Created a centralized provider registry in `upload_providers/__init__.py`:
     - Added `ProviderType` that automatically stays in sync with available providers
     - Added lazy loading of provider modules with caching
     - Added proper type hints and documentation for all interfaces
   - Improved type safety throughout the codebase:
     - Added proper return type hints for all functions
     - Added TypedDict for provider help messages
     - Added better error handling for protocol violations
   - Made the provider system more maintainable:
     - Single source of truth for provider list
     - Self-documenting interfaces
     - Better IDE support through type hints
     - Clearer separation between module and client interfaces

## TODO4:

1. âœ… Provider API Improvements (Completed in update 8):
   - Created formal provider interface using Protocol system
   - Added provider discovery with lazy loading
   - Implemented runtime protocol checking
   - Added comprehensive type hints
   - Moved provider-specific help messages to modules
   - Created centralized provider registry

2. Improve S3 provider API:
   - Add specific error types for S3-related failures:
     - Create custom exception hierarchy
     - Map AWS error codes to specific exceptions
     - Add detailed error messages and recovery hints
   - Add support for advanced AWS authentication:
     - IAM roles and instance profiles
     - AWS SSO credentials
     - Role assumption and chaining
   - Enhance S3 functionality:
     - Add support for bucket policies and ACLs
     - Implement S3 transfer acceleration
     - Add credential caching mechanism
     - Add support for S3-compatible services
   - Improve multipart uploads:
     - Add progress tracking
     - Add resume capability
     - Add parallel upload support
     - Add automatic retries

3. Enhance error handling and logging:
   - Replace broad exception catches (BLE001)
   - Add structured error logging
   - Improve error recovery mechanisms
   - Add detailed troubleshooting guides

4. Improve code quality:
   - Fix linter warnings about complexity
