# Development Log

## Changed

- Updated `catbox.py` to properly implement both `Provider` and `ProviderClient` protocols
  - Fixed method signatures to match protocol requirements
  - Improved error handling and logging
  - Added proper type hints for async/await patterns
  - Simplified code by removing redundant type variables
  - Made `get_credentials` and `get_provider` class methods
  - Fixed `ProviderHelp` type usage

- Updated `bashupload.py` to use shared utilities and follow protocol patterns
  - Removed dependency on `simple.py` base class
  - Properly implemented both `Provider` and `ProviderClient` protocols
  - Added async support with proper type hints
  - Simplified provider help dictionary
  - Improved error handling and logging
  - Added file validation
  - Standardized HTTP response handling
  - Fixed timeout handling in aiohttp client

## In Progress

- Refactoring upload providers to use shared utilities
  - Created `utils.py` with common functionality
  - Updated `catbox.py` and `bashupload.py` as example implementations
  - Need to update remaining providers to follow the same pattern

## Next Steps

1. Update remaining providers to use the shared utilities from `utils.py`
2. Ensure consistent async/await patterns across all providers
3. Add helper functions in `utils.py` for common async patterns if needed
4. Consider adding more utility functions for:
   - Standardized error handling
   - File validation and handling
   - HTTP response processing
   - Credential management
   - Logging and metrics

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Update all provider implementations to match the new protocol type hints
- [ ] Consider adding helper functions in `utils.py` for common async patterns
- [ ] Review and possibly simplify the provider protocols
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error handling in utility functions
- [ ] Consider adding retry mechanisms in utility functions
- [ ] Add tests for utility functions
- [ ] Document best practices for implementing providers

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Updated Provider protocols to better handle async/coroutine types
  - Modified return type of async_upload_file to accept both Awaitable[UploadResult] and Coroutine[Any, Any, UploadResult]
  - Added type variables for covariant return types (T_co, T_ret)
  - This change allows for more flexible async implementations while maintaining type safety
  - Providers can now use either async/await pattern or coroutines without type conflicts

### Technical Debt
- Need to update all provider implementations to match new protocol type hints
- Consider adding helper functions in utils.py to handle common async patterns
