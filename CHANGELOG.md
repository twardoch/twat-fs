# Development Log

## Changed

- Refactored multiple upload providers to use shared utilities from `utils.py`:
  - `pixeldrain.py`: Fixed recursion issues, improved error handling, standardized logging
  - `bashupload.py`: Implemented consistent error handling, improved HTTP response handling
  - `catbox.py`: Separated upload logic, standardized provider help format
  - `filebin.py`: Improved error handling, standardized logging
  - `uguu.py`: Separated upload logic, standardized provider help format
  - `www0x0.py`: Separated upload logic, standardized provider help format
  - `dropbox.py`: Made it inherit from BaseProvider, improved credential handling
  - `s3.py`: Created S3Provider class, improved error handling, standardized logging

- Created provider templates for standardized implementation:
  - `simple_provider_template.py`: For providers without authentication
  - `authenticated_provider_template.py`: For providers requiring credentials

- Updated `catbox.py` to properly implement both `Provider` and `ProviderClient` protocols
  - Fixed method signatures to match protocol requirements
  - Improved error handling and logging
  - Added proper type hints for async/await patterns
  - Simplified code by removing redundant type variables
  - Made `get_credentials` and `get_provider` class methods
  - Fixed `ProviderHelp` type usage

- Updated `bashupload.py` to use shared utilities and follow protocol patterns
  - Removed dependency on `simple.py` base class
  - Properly implemented both `Provider` and `ProviderClient` protocols
  - Added async support with proper type hints
  - Simplified provider help dictionary
  - Improved error handling and logging
  - Added file validation
  - Standardized HTTP response handling
  - Fixed timeout handling in aiohttp client

## In Progress

- Refactoring upload providers to use shared utilities
  - Created `utils.py` with common functionality
  - Refactored 8 providers to use the shared utilities
  - Remaining providers to refactor: `fal.py`, `litterbox.py`

- Implementing a factory pattern for provider instantiation
  - Will simplify creation of providers
  - Reduce code duplication in `get_provider()` methods

- Standardizing async/sync conversion patterns
  - Several providers implement both synchronous and asynchronous upload methods
  - Need to standardize this pattern using utilities in utils.py

## Next Steps

1. Complete refactoring of remaining providers (`fal.py`, `litterbox.py`)
2. Implement factory pattern for provider instantiation
3. Standardize async/await patterns across all providers
4. Add helper functions in `utils.py` for common async patterns
5. Write unit tests for utils.py functions
6. Document best practices for creating new providers

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Update all provider implementations to match the new protocol type hints
- [ ] Consider adding helper functions in `utils.py` for common async patterns
- [ ] Review and possibly simplify the provider protocols
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error handling in utility functions
- [ ] Consider adding retry mechanisms in utility functions
- [ ] Add tests for utility functions
- [ ] Document best practices for implementing providers

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Created utility functions in `utils.py` for common provider operations:
  - `create_provider_help`: Standardizes provider help dictionaries
  - `safe_file_handle`: Safely manages file operations
  - `validate_file`: Validates file existence and permissions
  - `handle_http_response`: Standardizes HTTP response handling
  - `get_env_credentials`: Simplifies credential management
  - `create_provider_instance`: Standardizes provider initialization
  - `standard_upload_wrapper`: Provides consistent upload handling
  - `log_upload_attempt`: Standardizes logging for upload attempts

- Created provider templates for standardized implementation:
  - `simple_provider_template.py`: For providers without authentication
  - `authenticated_provider_template.py`: For providers requiring credentials

### Changed
- Refactored multiple upload providers to use shared utilities:
  - `pixeldrain.py`, `bashupload.py`, `catbox.py`, `filebin.py`
  - `uguu.py`, `www0x0.py`, `dropbox.py`, `s3.py`

- Updated Provider protocols to better handle async/coroutine types
  - Modified return type of async_upload_file to accept both Awaitable[UploadResult] and Coroutine[Any, Any, UploadResult]
  - Added type variables for covariant return types (T_co, T_ret)
  - This change allows for more flexible async implementations while maintaining type safety
  - Providers can now use either async/await pattern or coroutines without type conflicts

### Technical Debt
- Need to update all provider implementations to match new protocol type hints
- Consider adding helper functions in utils.py to handle common async patterns
