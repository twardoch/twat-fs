# Development Log

## Changed

- Refactored all upload providers to use shared utilities from `utils.py`:
  - `pixeldrain.py`: Fixed recursion issues, improved error handling, standardized logging
  - `bashupload.py`: Implemented consistent error handling, standardized logging
  - `catbox.py`: Separated upload logic, standardized provider help format
  - `filebin.py`: Improved error handling, standardized logging
  - `uguu.py`: Separated upload logic, standardized provider help format
  - `www0x0.py`: Separated upload logic, standardized provider help format
  - `dropbox.py`: Made DropboxClient inherit from BaseProvider, standardized provider help format
  - `s3.py`: Created S3Provider class inheriting from BaseProvider, improved error handling
  - `fal.py`: Made FalProvider inherit from BaseProvider, improved error handling and credential management
  - `litterbox.py`: Made LitterboxProvider inherit from BaseProvider, improved error handling with special handling for expiration parameter

- Created provider templates for standardized implementation:
  - `simple_provider_template.py`: Template for providers without authentication
  - `authenticated_provider_template.py`: Template for providers requiring credentials

- Updated `catbox.py` and `bashupload.py` to properly implement both `Provider` and `ProviderClient` protocols
  - Improved error handling with `RetryableError` and `NonRetryableError`
  - Added standardized logging with `log_upload_attempt`
  - Enhanced type hints for better IDE support

## In Progress

- Implementing a factory pattern for provider instantiation to simplify provider creation and standardize error handling during initialization

- Standardizing async/sync conversion patterns for providers that support both operations

## Next Steps

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Implement additional upload providers from the TODO list
- Update documentation with new provider capabilities

## Technical Debt

- Update provider implementations to match new protocol type hints
- Add tests for utility functions
- Standardize error handling across all providers
- Improve documentation for adding new providers

# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Created utility functions in `utils.py` for common provider operations:
  - `create_provider_help`: Standardizes provider help dictionaries
  - `safe_file_handle`: Safely manages file operations
  - `validate_file`: Validates file existence and permissions
  - `handle_http_response`: Standardizes HTTP response handling
  - `get_env_credentials`: Simplifies credential management
  - `create_provider_instance`: Standardizes provider initialization
  - `standard_upload_wrapper`: Provides consistent upload handling
  - `log_upload_attempt`: Standardizes logging for upload attempts

- Created provider templates for standardized implementation:
  - `simple_provider_template.py`: For providers without authentication
  - `authenticated_provider_template.py`: For providers requiring credentials

### Changed
- Refactored all upload providers to use shared utilities from `utils.py`:
  - `pixeldrain.py`, `bashupload.py`, `catbox.py`, `filebin.py`
  - `uguu.py`, `www0x0.py`, `dropbox.py`, `s3.py`

- Updated Provider protocols to better handle async/coroutine types
  - Modified return type of async_upload_file to accept both Awaitable[UploadResult] and Coroutine[Any, Any, UploadResult]
  - Added type variables for covariant return types (T_co, T_ret)
  - This change allows for more flexible async implementations while maintaining type safety
  - Providers can now use either async/await pattern or coroutines without type conflicts

### Fixed
- Fixed recursion issue in `pixeldrain.py` `get_provider` method
- Improved error handling with proper exception chaining across all providers
- Enhanced HTTP response handling with standardized status code processing
- Fixed type annotation issues in multiple providers
- Resolved inconsistencies in async/sync conversion patterns
