# Development Log

## Completed

- Refactored all upload providers to use shared utilities from `utils.py`:
  - `pixeldrain.py`: Fixed recursion issues, improved error handling, standardized logging
  - `bashupload.py`: Implemented consistent error handling, standardized logging
  - `catbox.py`: Separated upload logic, standardized provider help format
  - `filebin.py`: Improved error handling, standardized logging
  - `uguu.py`: Separated upload logic, standardized provider help format
  - `www0x0.py`: Separated upload logic, standardized provider help format
  - `dropbox.py`: Made DropboxClient inherit from BaseProvider, standardized provider help format
  - `s3.py`: Created S3Provider class inheriting from BaseProvider, improved error handling
  - `fal.py`: Made FalProvider inherit from BaseProvider, improved error handling and credential management
  - `litterbox.py`: Made LitterboxProvider inherit from BaseProvider, improved error handling with special handling for expiration parameter

- Created provider templates for standardized implementation:
  - `simple_provider_template.py`: Template for providers without authentication
  - `authenticated_provider_template.py`: Template for providers requiring credentials

- Updated `catbox.py` and `bashupload.py` to properly implement both `Provider` and `ProviderClient` protocols
  - Improved error handling with `RetryableError` and `NonRetryableError`
  - Added standardized logging with `log_upload_attempt`
  - Enhanced type hints for better IDE support

- Implemented a factory pattern for provider instantiation to simplify provider creation and standardize error handling during initialization

- Standardized async/sync conversion patterns for providers that support both operations

- Created comprehensive unit tests for utility functions

## In Progress

- Fixing type annotation issues identified by linter
  - Addressing incompatible return types in async methods
  - Fixing type mismatches in factory.py and simple.py
  - Ensuring proper typing for async/await conversions
  - Resolving "possibly unbound" variable warnings in upload.py

- Fixing failing unit tests
  - TestCreateProviderInstance tests failing due to missing '__name__' attribute on mocks
  - TestLogUploadAttempt.test_log_upload_attempt_success test failing because logger.info is not being called
  - TestGatherWithConcurrency.test_gather_with_concurrency_with_exceptions test failing with RuntimeError instead of ValueError

- Addressing linter issues in cleanup.py
  - DTZ005: datetime.datetime.now() called without a tz argument
  - FBT001/FBT002: Boolean-typed positional arguments
  - S603/S607: Subprocess call security issues

## Next Steps

- Fix exception handling issues with proper exception chaining
- Update pyproject.toml to move 'per-file-ignores' to 'lint.per-file-ignores' section
- Implement additional upload providers from the TODO list
- Update documentation with new provider capabilities
- Refine HTTP response handling across providers

## Technical Debt

- Update provider implementations to match new protocol type hints
- Standardize error handling across all providers
- Improve documentation for adding new providers
- Fix linter warnings related to boolean arguments and function complexity
- Refactor complex functions in cli.py and upload.py
